    <h1>Best Hacking Movies of All Time!!!</h1>
    <h2>My favourite hacking movies of all time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>WarGames (19983)</h3>
    <p>Released during the height of the Cold War, WarGames follows the story of a high school student who inadvertently breaks into the United States Air Force’s missile launch system. Through this shockingly easy discovery, the story’s main character is thrust into a world of trouble, ranging from FBI agents arresting him to being suspected as a Russian double agent attempting to sabotage the United States.</p>
    <h3>Sneakers (1993)</h3>
    <p>With the entire plot focused on a group of computer hackers, known in the movie as Sneakers but better known as penetration testers, it’s one of the best hacker movies of all time. The story follows Martin who leads a team of specialists conducting penetration testing services for companies.</p>
    <h3>The Matrix 1993</h3>
    <p>The Matrix comes in as perhaps the most popular movie on the entire list. While it certainly captures mass public interest from around the world, the story only portrays hacking during a few of its scenes. </p>
    <h3>Hackers (1993)</h3>

    <h3>Takedown (2000)</h3>
    <p>The story follows one of the hacker community’s most famous hackers, Kevin Mitnick, and his eventual arrest. </p>
    <h3>Tron (1982)</h3>
    <p>Tron takes the classic story of a hacker fighting against the big evil company to a pinnacle. The story follows a talented computer engineer, whose work has been stolen by the firm’s executive.</p>

    <h3>The Italian Job (2003)</h3>
    <p>While hacking is only a small portion of The Italian Job, it offered the 21st century one of the first accurate depictions of how hacking works. </p>
